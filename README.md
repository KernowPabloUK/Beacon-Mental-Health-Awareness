### Description

The purpose of this website is to allow external users to access accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health and stress management and recognize the signs in others requiring support. As a site owner, the site is designed to be welcoming and calming with an organized layout to assist external users' usage.

This has been built using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome icons. Excluding items listed below (AI Usage Within the Project), all code/work is my own with no external sources.

### AI Usage Within the Project

-   AI used to refine user stories into tasks and acceptance criteria.
-   AI used to generate all images and logo design.
-   AI used to generate affirmation message text throughout the site, Mental Health and Stress Management tips, resources, and signs on how to recognize text.
-   AI used to generate description and meta keywords for SEO within <head>.
-   AI used to generate boilerplate lists and cards for efficiency.
-   AI used for optimization and accessibility suggestions.
-   AI used for CSS & HTML code review.

AI (Copilot) was used to enhance the development process, but developmental control was retained by the developer. AI was helpful in generating images and text based on appropriate prompting, and for creating boilerplates. However, boilerplates still required in-depth review by the developer to fix errors and remove additional, unnecessary classes and semantic tags. This resulted in time spent that could have been better utilized in the primary development itself.

Upon usage of AI for optimization and code review, the results were hit and miss, with approximately 65% of suggestions being unnecessary, creating unwanted layout changes within the site or causing issues when validating HTML with W3C, which had to be rectified.

In summary, AI was a useful tool when directed at the correct job/role, but at present is not a substitute for utilizing a senior developer when conducting code reviews, as you should not insert code suggestions from AI unless you understand and can explain what the inserted code is doing.
